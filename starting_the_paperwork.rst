Select a name
=============

* The name of an organization establishes its brand, so it is important to keep that in mind when selecting the name of your non-profit.
* After the name is chosen, verify that it does not conflict with any other organization registered in the state.
* California operates a site to verify the names of organizations in the state [#]_.

Choose a nonprofit corporation structure
========================================

* There are different corporate structures for nonprofit corporations, but the public benefits corporations are those seeking IRS exemptions 501(c)(3).

* Your organization may be qualifying for exemption under 501(c)(3) if it is organized and operated exclusively for one or more of the following purposes:

  * Religious
  * Charitable
  * Scientific
  * Testing for public safety
  * Literary
  * Educational
  * Foster National or International Amateur Sports Competition
  * Cruelty to Children or Animals Organizations
 
Form Your Board Of Directors
============================

* Directors make up the governing body of your nonprofit corporation and are stakeholders in your organization’s purpose and success.
* You’ll want to identify three, unrelated (by blood or marriage) individuals to meet IRS requirements.
* You will also want to be aware of any age or residency requirements.

File articles of incorporation
==============================

* Your nonprofit article of incorporation is an official documentation filed with your secretary of state to legally document the creation of your organization.
* That document captures information such as the organization's name, location, board of directors, and purpose.
* While the requirements of the language in the articles of incorporation vary from state to state, it is important to ensure that the language used in the articles for your organization meet IRS requirements for when you apply for the tax-exempt status later.

Write by-laws
=============

* Once your articles of incorporation have been approved, the next step will be to write your bylaws.
* These are your nonprofit’s operating manual to guide the board’s actions and decisions.
* They are helpful in preventing or resolving conflicts and disagreements and guide procedures such as voting and electing officers.
* You will need to include a copy of your bylaws in your 501(c)(3) application.
 
Hold first board meeting
========================

* At this point your Article of Incorporation has already been filed and approved by your state.
* And you also appointed a temporary chair and secretary.
* The temporary chair will conduct the meeting and the temporary secretary will record the minutes.
* At the first board meeting, you will need to adopt the bylaws and appoint the board officers.
* It is also recommended that at your first board meeting, you authorize someone to file your 501(c)(3) application.
 
File For EIN
============
* The final step before filing your 501(c)(3) application is to apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN).
* This is a unique, nine-digit number assigned by the IRS to identify your nonprofit.
* You will need your EIN later to open a bank account, apply for 501(c)(3) status, and submit 990 returns to the IRS.
